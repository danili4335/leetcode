Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
```
**Note:** In the string, each word is separated by single space and there will not be any extra space in the string.

**Complexity Analysis**
* Solution1, Solution2
  * **Time complexity** : O(n). where n is the length of the string.
  * **Space complexity** : O(n). res of size n is used.
